Welcome! I'm a first-year PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in development and health economics, in addition to the economics of science and innovation. Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at UC San Diego and the J-PAL [Payments & Governance Research Program](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/pgrp/home), and received a BSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics.
