Hello! ðŸ˜Š My name is Wilson King, and I am currently a Pre-Doctoral Fellow in Economics at the University of California, San Diego, working under Professors Paul Niehaus and Karthik Muralidharan. I am affiliated with the [Payments & Governance Research Program](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/pgrp/home) of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), providing research assistance to ongoing experimental evaluations of India's transition to direct benefit transfer systems of social welfare distribution. I am an aspiring applied microeconomist, with particular interests in health, development, and applied econometrics.

Prior to joining UCSD, I spent three years at the London School of Economics (LSE), where I graduated in July of 2022 with a BSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics. At the LSE, I worked as an occasional research assistant to Dr. Timothy Hildebrandt, analyzing survey data for insights into patterns of prosocial behavior among Chinese Communist Party members. In addition, I wrote an undergraduate thesis on the effects of Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions on county-level mortality rates in the United States.
